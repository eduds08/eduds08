# Welcome to My GitHub!

Hello! I'm Eduardo de Sá Coêlho Ribeiro Costa, a Computer Engineering undergraduate from Brazil. I have a passion for programming and research, particularly in signal processing and machine learning.

## About Me

I am currently involved in two main research projects:

1. **Simulation and Reconstruction of Acoustic Signals**  
   Working on the project [acoustic-sim-toolkit](https://github.com/eduds08/acoustic-sim-toolkit), which focuses on implementing an acoustic wave simulator using WebGPU. This project aims to aid in the analysis and reconstruction of seismic events.

2. **Early Failure Detection in UPS Systems**  
   Applying data science and machine learning to predict failures in UPS systems, with the goal of increasing the reliability and efficiency of these systems.

## Languages and Tools

- **Python**
- **C++**
- **WebGPU**
- **MySQL**
